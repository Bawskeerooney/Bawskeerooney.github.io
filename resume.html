	Hey, my name is Aidan. I love the ocean, engineering, and exploring unsolved problems. I loved my first internship as a software engineer at alwaysAI, a San Diego startup because it introduced me to solving complex problems through computer vision. This led me to work on my current project which is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). I am currently working on engineering an AUV for the University of San Diego robotics team. The possibility of solving relevant and complex engineering problems is what motivates me to consistently work on our robot which we will enter into the annual RoboSub competition.
